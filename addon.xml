    <summary lang="en">Tetrad is an experimental fork of JX720 that aims to support modern Kodi at a more fitting resolution.</summary>
    <description lang="en">Tetrad is a project forked from a defunct XBMC skin called JX720, which itself is a from-the-ground-up rewrite of the classic XBMC skin MC360 created by Jezz_X. Tetrad aims to target 3440x1440 WQHD UlraWide resolution natively and get properly ported up the chain of XBMC releases and eventually support modern Kodi. After that I hope that Tetrad will go on to get improved and updated with new features and stay up to date.</description>
