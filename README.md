MC360... JX720... ProjectTetrad

This is a just for fun project but hopefully will evolve into a skin compatable with the latest Kodi stable releases. 
First thing, all the textures provided by Jezz_X and Blackbolt have ran through a deep learning photo program with AI models specifically used for computer graphics to generate textures suitable for creating 3840x2160 aka native 4K. 
With 1280x720, which is what JX720 displays natively for XBMC gui to upscale, I suspect that targeting native 4K support should be fairly trivial since comparing 4K to 720, 4K is exactly 3x the pixels.
