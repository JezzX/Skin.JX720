# Tetrad

Tetrad is a project forked from a defunct XBMC skin called JX720, which itself is a fromthe ground up rewrite of the classic XBMC skin MC360 created by Jezz_X.
Tetrad aims to target 3440x1440 WQHD UlraWide resolution natively and get properly ported up the chain of XBMC releases and eventually support modern Kodi.
After that I hope that Tetrad will go on to get improved and updated with new features and stay up to date.
